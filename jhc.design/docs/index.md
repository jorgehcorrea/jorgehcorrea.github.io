# jhc.design BACKEND
You have just reached my backend home site. If you wish to go back to my nice home click [here: take me back to jhc.design](http://www.jhc.design)  

If you are curious why you got here, im working on another concept of portfolio where I via git bash upload my work in a manner that fully documents all my progress and shows my work fully instead of just the end pictures. Of course the pretty pictures will always be at the top. Its my way of 1 hosting my web for free and 2 actually show my work and be able to go back to my work and replicate any part of it for new projects.

##Simple Image hosting
Hosted images in dorpbox, and switched the www.dorpbox.com to dl.dorpboxusercontent.com in order to make it hostable. Not sure why the images would not be picked up by the mkdocs. Proof of concept:
