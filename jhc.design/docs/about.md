#About Me
The reality is the experience and understanding of creating objects is the key to properly create new ones. Always had a passion for create new products. Things to use, seat on and interact with. Understanding is key, attitude is king.  

I'm curious first. Am a designer mostly, and life long student. Graduated from Carleton University as a bachelor of Industrial design, did a specialization in Footwear design in IED Madrid.  

Developed in Quito's manufacturing industry regarding Construction Furniture and Footwear design, always in-house, always next to the factory.
