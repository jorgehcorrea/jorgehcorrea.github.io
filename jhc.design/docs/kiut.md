#Bunky & Kiut Collaboration
Through the marketing team, the design team developed a concept to complement a high end notebook line known in Latino America as [KIUT](https://www.tiendanorma.com/kiut/cuadernos/?O=OrderByBestDiscountDESC). The final project was never released as the focused group didn't have the response expected and the final project was scraped. However the development fueled later projects in bunky's product line.
